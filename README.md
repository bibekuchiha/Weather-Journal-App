## Overview
This project includes an asynchronous web application that uses the Web API 
and User data to update the UI dynamically.

## Instructions

This will require modification of the file 'server.js' and of the file 'website/app.js.' 
You can see 'index.html' for references to the elements, and once finished 
You can use 'style.css' on project steps to style your application to 
Tailored perfection.

## Extras

If you want to test your code as you go, you can use 'tests.js' as 
A template to write your code and run some basic tests.

## Development
If you want to continue coding locally you need 'nodejs and npm' 
Built-in. You can test that in terminal, by running 'node -v &&npm -v,' 
Which should give rise to two terminal versions.

Once you have installed 'nodejs and npm' you simply run 'npm start' which executes an express 
Locally server, and serve static files. Additionally in allows two 
Parameters. One is a project data get and the other a post project data get get.

## Done

What did they do? I upgraded the 'server.js' with two endpoints and I needed to 
Middleware for body parser and corset enable.
I created several functions in 'website / app.js' to retrieve weather data from 
OpenWeatherAPI, storing data and updating the UI through the post request 
In dynamics.

Try it out!
